A CLI Dungeon Mastering Tool for your Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5e games.

This project is a little mini-project that I'm doing to further enhance my coding abilities.
It's supposed to be a tool that helps Dungeon Masters in the hit Table Top RPG game Dungeons & Dragons (5th Edition).
For now, it's just a CLI tool that I'm working on, using Test-Driven-Development to develop the individual components required to make the whole thing.
If this project takes off further, I plan to integrate this into a Laravel framework so that it can be used to host game online with the entire party.

For now, let's just see where this goes.
